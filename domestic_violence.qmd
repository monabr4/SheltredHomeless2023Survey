### The percentage of those experiencing domestic violence by Service Planning Agencies (SPA).

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

grouped_data <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(SPA_NAME) %>%
  summarise(
    total_count = n())

grouped_data2 <- merged_data %>%
  filter(domViol == "Yes") %>%
  group_by(SPA_NAME) %>%
  summarise(
    total_count_domViolYes = n())


combined_data <- left_join(grouped_data, grouped_data2, by = "SPA_NAME")
combined_data <- tidyr::replace_na(combined_data, list(total_count_domViolYes = 0))

combined_data$domViolYes_ratio <- round((combined_data$total_count_domViolYes / combined_data$total_count) * 100, 2)

grouped_data <- combined_data %>% select(SPA_NAME, domViolYes_ratio)

geojson_data <- st_read("~/Desktop/SheltredHomeless2023Survey/data/better.geojson", quiet = TRUE)


merged_geojson <- merge(geojson_data, grouped_data, by = "SPA_NAME", all.x = TRUE)

color_palette <- viridis_pal()(nrow(merged_geojson))


leaflet() %>%

  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>%
  
  addPolygons(
    data = merged_geojson,
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    stroke = TRUE,
    weight = 1,
    fillColor = ~color_palette,
    highlight = highlightOptions(
      weight = 2,
      fillOpacity = 0.5,
      bringToFront = TRUE
    ),
    label = ~paste("SPA NAME: ", SPA_NAME, " - Experience Domestic Violence (%): ", domViolYes_ratio)
  )

```

This map presents the percentage of individuals experiencing domestic violence in different Service Planning Agencies (SPA). About 32.24% of surveyed individuals residing in SPA West, including cities such as Santa Monica, Venice, and Malibu, report experiencing domestic violence. In SPA San Fernando, recognized as "the valley," approximately 31.17% of surveyed individuals reveal experiences of domestic violence. SPA East has the lowest percentage, at around 20.25% of individuals living in this area report experiencing domestic abuse.

### **Age: Are there age-related differences in the prevalence of domestic abuse among homeless individuals?**

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
merged_data <- na.omit(merged_data)

filtered_data <- merged_data[merged_data$domViol == "Yes", ]

percentages <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(age_catb) %>%
  summarise(percentage_noDomViol = n() / nrow(filtered_data))

bar_chart <- ggplot(percentages, aes(x = age_catb, y = percentage_noDomViol, fill = age_catb, label = scales::percent(percentage_noDomViol))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Percent of Domestic Abuse Among Sheltered Homeless Individuals by Age)",
       x = "Age Category",
       y = "Percentage",
       fill = "Age Category")
bar_chart


```

This graph shows age-related differences in the percentage of domestic abuse among homeless individuals. The youngest age group (18-24) reports a relatively lower percentage of domestic abuse at approximately 14.6%. In the 55-61 age category, the percentage slightly decreases to 12.5%. The majority of those experiencing domestic abuse fall within the age range of 25-54 (65%). The lowest reported percentage, at 7.8%, is observed in the 62 years and older age group.

### Race: How does the presence of domestic abuse differ among various racial and ethnic groups?

#### 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)

merged_data$race_nofa <- factor(merged_data$race_nofa)

proportions <- merged_data %>%
  filter(domViol == "Yes") %>%
  group_by(race_nofa) %>%
  summarise(proportion_domViol = n() / nrow(merged_data[merged_data$domViol == "Yes", ]))

plot_ly(proportions, labels = ~race_nofa, values = ~proportion_domViol, type = "pie",
        textinfo = "label+percent", insidetextorientation = "horizontal") %>%
  layout(title = "Percentage of Each Race Among Those Who Have Experienced Domestic Abuse",
         showlegend = TRUE) 






```

The analysis of domestic abuse prevalence among sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County reveals distinct racial disparities. Approximately 42% of Blacks and 50.3% of Whites report experiencing domestic abuse. The remaining racial and ethnic groups represent less than 7.7% of those experiencing domestic abuse.

### 

### Gender: How does gender influence the experiences of homelessness and the impact of domestic abuse?

### 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


merged_data <- na.omit(merged_data)

domestic_abuse_data <- merged_data[merged_data$domViol == "Yes", ]
percentages <- domestic_abuse_data %>%
  group_by(male) %>%
  summarise(percentage = n() / nrow(domestic_abuse_data) * 100)

ggplot(percentages, aes(x = factor(male), y = percentage, fill = factor(male))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Percentage Distribution of Gender Among Those Experiencing Domestic Abuse",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Percentage",
       fill = "Gender") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("0" = "purple", "1" = "darkgreen"),
                    name = "Gender",
                    labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage), "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            size = 3) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("0" = "Female", "1" = "Male")) 

```

The bar graph provides a representation of the gender distribution among those facing domestic abuse. The majority of individuals experiencing domestic abuse in the survey for shelter individuals identify as female (72% ). In contrast, males make up 28% of the population experiencing domestic abuse.

```{r}
