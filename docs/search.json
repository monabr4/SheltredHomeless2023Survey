SPA East reports the highest percentage, with 40.86% experiencing some form of substance abuse. In SPA Metro, which includes downtown LA, the second-highest percentage of 21.56% experiencing substance abuse. On the contrary, San Gabriel SPA has the lowest rate at 7.53%. These disparities underscore the need for targeted interventions and specialized support systems within each SPA.\n\n\nAge: Are there age-related differences in the prevalence of substance abuse among homeless individuals?\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those aged 18-24, drug abuse is the highest, overall substance abuse is the lowest in this age group. For individuals between the ages of 25-54, nearly 30% report the concurrent abuse of drugs and alcohol, while approximately 24% specifically report drug abuse. In the 55-61 age category, the percent abuse of both substances is 5.94% among those disclosing substance abuse. In the oldest category (62+), alcohol abuse is the most common type of substance abuse.\n\n\nRace: How does the presence of substance abuse differ among various racial groups?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of substance abuse prevalence among sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County reveals significant racial disparities. Approximately 60.1% of Whites report experiencing some form of substance abuse, indicating a substantial impact within this racial group. In comparison, 33.3% of Blacks also report substance abuse experiences.\n\n\nGender: How does gender influence the experiences of homelessness and the impact of domestic abuse?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of substance abuse among sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County shows a gender disparity. Of those experiencing substance abuse, 69% identify as male, while 31% identify as female.\n\n\nConclusion:\nSubstance abuse often makes it harder for homeless individuals to find stable housing, creating a tough situation that’s difficult to break out of. It is important to identify which populations are most affected and to create a plan to solve this public health issue. Our findings suggest that those who are in the age range 25-54 experience are at a higher risk of abusing substances. Among those who experience substance abuse, 60.1% are white, 69% are male. East SPA (ex. City of Commerce, Bell Garden, Cerritos, etc.) has the highest percentage (40.86%) of individuals living in that SPA experiencing substance abuse. Understanding the demographics can help provide policy makers, nonprofits, the general public and more to create substance abuse prevention plans for different sub-populations."

About 23.4% of surveyed individuals residing in SPA Antelope Valley, including cities such as Lancaster and Palmdale report experiencing domestic violence. The second highest percentage of experiencing domestic abuse is SPA West. About 22.9% of surveyed individuals residing in SPA West, including cities such as Santa Monica, Venice, and Malibu, report experiencing domestic violence. SPA Gabriel has the lowest percentage, at around 10.1% of individuals living in this area report experiencing domestic abuse.\n\n\nAge: Are there age-related differences in the prevalence of domestic abuse among homeless individuals?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows age-related differences in the percentage of domestic abuse among homeless individuals. The youngest age group (18-24) reports a relatively lower percentage of domestic abuse at approximately 14.6%. In the 55-61 age category, the percentage slightly decreases to 12.5%. The majority of those experiencing domestic abuse fall within the age range of 25-54 (65%). The lowest reported percentage, at 7.8%, is observed in the 62 years and older age group.\n\n\nRace: How does the presence of domestic abuse differ among various racial and ethnic groups?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of domestic abuse prevalence among sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County reveals distinct racial disparities. Approximately 40.9% of Blacks and 51.3% of Whites report experiencing domestic abuse. The remaining racial and ethnic groups represent less than 10.4% of those experiencing domestic abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender: How does gender influence the experiences of homelessness and the impact of domestic abuse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar graph provides a representation of the gender distribution among those facing domestic abuse. The majority of individuals experiencing domestic abuse in the survey for shelter individuals identify as female (72%). In contrast, males make up 28% of the population experiencing domestic abuse.\n\n\nConclusion:\nHomelessness and domestic violence can intersect, as individuals feeling abusive homes may find themselves without shelter, making it difficult to escape violence. Also, those who face homelessness may be at highest risk of domestic violence. Among those who experience domestic violence, 72% are females, 40.9% are black, 51.3% are white, and 65% are between the ages of 25 and 54. SPA Antelope Valley (ex. Palmdale and Lancaster, etc.) has the highest percentage (23.4%) of individuals living in that SPA experiencing domestic violence abuse. Understanding the demographics can help provide policy makers,  nonprofits, the general public and more to create domestic violence intervention plans for different subpopulation."

    "text": "Understanding the demographics of homelessness in Los Angeles is crucial for specialized interventions and equitable resource allocation. It allows policymakers to create solutions to specific needs, especially for vulnerable populations. Beyond policy considerations, this understanding fosters empathy and informs compassionate decision-making, contributing to holistic and sustainable efforts to eradicate homelessness in the Los Angeles County.\nThe 2023 dataset from LAHSA exclusively focuses on sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County, comprising 10,000 to 14,000 records from the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). Distinct patterns in the sheltered population, including larger shares of women, children, and newly homeless individuals, are revealed. Presented in household and individual formats, UCLA’s Paul Beeman has standardized the records for enhanced consistency. The dataset, available in its original, de-identified form, along with a questionnaire and standardized version codebook, provides a focused resource for exploring the attributes and experiences of sheltered individuals during 2023.\nData Set can be found: https://economicrt.org/publication/los-angeles-county-homeless-count-data-library/\n\n\n\nThe research questions aim to explore the intersection of domestic abuse and substance abuse, stratified by age, race,gender, and sexual orientation. By examining age-specific trends, racial variations, and gender variations, we seek to inform targeted interventions that address the unique challenges faced by different subpopulations. This research is essential for the development of inclusive support systems at the intersection of domestic and substance abuse.\n\n\nDomestic Abuse and Homelessness:\nHow are differences in age, race, sexual orientation, and gender dynamics linked to variations in experiences of domestic abuse among sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County, highlighting potential disparities?\nSubstance Abuse and Homelessness:\nHow are differences in age, race, sexual orientation, and gender dynamics linked to variations in experiences of substance abuse among sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County, highlighting potential disparities?\nSubstance Abuse and Domestic Abuse:\nHow does the presence of substance abuse correlate with experiences of domestic abuse among sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County? Additionally, are there variations in this relationship based on demographic factors such as age, race, sexual orientation, and gender?\n\n\n\nInitially, the dataset was loaded into Excel. The dataset contained +1,000 columns. The essential columns were selected for further analysis. The condensed dataset was imported into R columns were clarified, variables were recoded, and dataset merging was done.\nhttps://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/e9134f735c0c473d8156f4703a687ce9/explore?location=33.954160%2C-118.298576%2C9.56\n\n#Import Library\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n\n#Import Data \nSheltered_Individuals &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/2023 Homeless Data /[WORKING]2023-HMIS-Records-of-Sheltered-Individuals.csv\")\n\nRows: 15674 Columns: 29\n\n\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (25): EnrollmentID_a, hhid_a, hhold_type, physical_yn, hiv, domViol, fle...\ndbl  (4): n_hhmem, n_chronic, n_vet, age_yrs\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nhead(Sheltered_Individuals)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 29\n  EnrollmentID_a hhid_a n_hhmem n_chronic n_vet hhold_type     physical_yn hiv  \n  &lt;chr&gt;
