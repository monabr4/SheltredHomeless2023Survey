### The percentage of those who abuse substances by Service Planning Agencies (SPA).

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

grouped_2 <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(SPA_NAME) %>%
  summarise(denominator = n())

grouped_1 <- merged_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(subsAbuse_type) & subsAbuse_type != "None") %>%
  group_by(SPA_NAME) %>%
  summarise(
    numerator = n()
  )

combined_data <- left_join(grouped_2, grouped_1, by = "SPA_NAME")
combined_data <- tidyr::replace_na(combined_data, list(numerator = 0, denominator = 0))

combined_data <- combined_data %>%
  mutate(subsAbuseYes_ratio = round((numerator / denominator) * 100, 2))

grouped_subs_data <- combined_data %>% select(SPA_NAME, subsAbuseYes_ratio)

geojson_data <- st_read("~/Desktop/SheltredHomeless2023Survey/data/better.geojson", quiet = TRUE)
merged_geojson_subs <- merge(geojson_data, grouped_subs_data, by = "SPA_NAME", all.x = TRUE)
color_palette_subs <- viridis_pal()(nrow(merged_geojson_subs))

leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>%
  addPolygons(
    data = merged_geojson_subs,
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    stroke = TRUE,
    weight = 1,
    fillColor = ~color_palette_subs,
    highlight = highlightOptions(
      weight = 2,
      fillOpacity = 0.5,
      bringToFront = TRUE
    ),
    label = ~paste("SPA NAME: ", SPA_NAME, " - Experience Substance Abuse (%): ", subsAbuseYes_ratio)
  )

```

Analyzing substance abuse percentages across Service Planning Agencies (SPA) shows distinct rates. SPA East reports the highest percentage, with 40.8% experiencing some form of substance abuse. In Metro, which includes downtown LA, the second-highest percentage of 21.56% experiencing substance abuse. On the contrary, San Gabriel SPA has the lowest rate at 7.53%. These disparities underscore the need for targeted interventions and tailored support systems within each SPA, addressing the specific challenges faced by the people who experience homelessness.

### Age: Are there age-related differences in the prevalence of substance abuse among homeless individuals?

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

filtered_data <- merged_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(subsAbuse_type) & subsAbuse_type != "None")

grouped_data <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(subsAbuse_type, age_catb) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
grouped_data

bar_chart <- ggplot(grouped_data, aes(x = age_catb, y = count/sum(count), fill = subsAbuse_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(count/sum(count))),
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 3, hjust = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Percent of Substance Abuse Types by Age Category",
       x = "Age Category",
       y = "Percent (%)",
       fill = "Substance Abuse Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

print(bar_chart)

```

 Among those aged 18-24, drug abuse is the highest, overall substance abuse is the lowest in this age group. For individuals between the ages of 25-54, nearly 30% report the concurrent abuse of drugs and alcohol, while approximately 24% specifically report drug abuse. In the 55-61 age category, the percent abuse of both substances is 5.94% among those disclosing substance abuse. In the oldest category (61+), alcohol abuse emerges as the predominant form of substance abuse.

### Race: How does the presence of substance abuse differ among various racial groups?

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
merged_data <- na.omit(merged_data)

substance_abuse_data <- merged_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(subsAbuse_type) & subsAbuse_type != "None")

proportions <- substance_abuse_data %>%
  group_by(race_nofa) %>%
  summarise(percentage_substanceAbuse = n() / nrow(substance_abuse_data) * 100)

plot_ly(proportions, labels = ~race_nofa, values = ~percentage_substanceAbuse, type = "pie",
        textinfo = "label+percent", insidetextorientation = "radial") %>%
  layout(title = "Distribution of Substance Abuse by Race")


```

The analysis of substance abuse prevalence among sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County reveals significant racial disparities. Approximately 60.1% of Whites report experiencing substance abuse, indicating a substantial impact within this racial group. In comparison, 33.3% of Blacks also report substance abuse experiences.

### Gender: How does gender influence the experiences of homelessness and the impact of domestic abuse?

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

merged_data <- na.omit(merged_data)
substance_abuse_data <- merged_data[merged_data$subsAbuse_type != "None", ]

percentages <- substance_abuse_data %>%
  group_by(male) %>%
  summarise(percentage = n() / nrow(substance_abuse_data) * 100)

ggplot(percentages, aes(x = factor(male), y = percentage, fill = factor(male))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Percentage Distribution of Gender Among Those Experiencing Substance Abuse",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Percentage",
       fill = "Gender") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("0" = "purple", "1" = "darkgreen"),
                    name = "Gender",
                    labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage), "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            size = 3) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("0" = "Female", "1" = "Male")) 
```

The analysis of substance abuse among sheltered individuals in Los Angeles County shows a gender disparity. Of those experiencing substance abuse, 69% identify as male, while 31% identify as female.
